## Overview

iQmetrix APIs are simple but powerful HTTP interfaces that are inspired by the REST architectural style. These are the same APIs that our internal development teams use to build products.

We are passionate about creating a great [developer experience](http://www.iqmetrix.com/our-company) for you so please don't hesitate to contact our <a href="mailto:{{site.support_email}}?subject=API Feedback">API Support Team</a> with any feedback related to API design, usability, or features that you are interested to see.

These iQmetrix Developer concepts are intended to help you integrate with our platform APIs. We'll cover the basics of each platform module, giving you more insight into our APIs.
